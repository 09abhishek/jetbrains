# Rainglow

## JetBrains IDEs (PHPStorm, Webstorm, etc)
Rainglow is a collection of color themes for a number of different editors and platforms. This repository consists of **80+ syntax and UI themes** for [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/) including PHPStorm, Webstorm and more.

Please note that these themes use the Material Darker theme by [Chris Magnussen](https://github.com/ChrisRM) as a base for compatibility. Thanks for all your hard work Chris!

### Easy Installation

Go to your IDE's settings, select `Plugins -> Browse Repositories...` search for and install 'Rainglow Color Schemes'. Restart your IDE, and the themes will be available within the Colour Schemes drop down within the settings dialog. Enjoy!

### Semi-Manual Installation

Navigate to the Plugins section of your IDE's settings dialog, and choose to install a plugin from disk. Install using the `rainglow.jar` file from the repository. Restart your IDE, and the themes will be available within the Colour Schemes drop down within the settings dialog. Enjoy!

### Full-Manual Installation

Navigate to the editor colors section of your editors settings and import any of the XML files from the colors directory within this repository. Note: Some versions of JetBrains IDE's require you to rename the `.xml` files to `.icls` files before import. Enjoy!

### Notes

JetBrains IDE's are a little painful to theme due to the amount of flexibility and language support they have. These color schemes will not look exactly like the themes for Sublime or VSCode. Instead, I've found the best theme layout possible within JetBrains rendering ability. Please don't complain if they don't look exactly like the VSCode themes!

Also note that these are only syntax colour schemes. To pimp your IDE UI, I highly recommend the [Material Theme for JetBrains](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) plugin from Chris Magnussen. It's a beautiful UI theme that you can see in the provided example screenshots.

### Useful Information

This project is an evolution of my colour schemes project found at [https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes). Peacock was the first ever theme. I created it to try and find something to use other than Monokai. It's now a favourite for many users!

If you'd like to report a bug with one of the color schemes, please raise an issue on the repository rather than submitting a pull request. This is because the themes run through a generation process, and editing the themes directly is not advised!

Have a wonderful day!
