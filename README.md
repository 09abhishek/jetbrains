# Rainglow

## JetBrains IDEs (PHPStorm, Webstorm, etc)
Rainglow is a collection of color themes for a number of different editors and platforms. This repository consists of **80+ syntax and UI themes** for [JetBrains editors](https://www.jetbrains.com/) including PHPStorm, Webstorm and more.

Please note that these themes use the Material Darker theme by [Chris Magnussen](https://github.com/ChrisRM) as a base for compatibility. Thanks for all your hard work Chris!

### Manual Installation

Navigate to the editor colors section of your editors settings and import any of the XML files from the themes directory within this repository.

### Useful Information

This project is an evolution of my colour schemes project found at [https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes). Peacock was the first ever theme. I created it to try and find something to use other than Monokai. It's now a favourite for many users!

If you'd like to report a bug with one of the color schemes, please raise an issue on the repository rather than submitting a pull request. This is because the themes run through a generation process, and editing the themes directly is not advised!

Have a wonderful day!
